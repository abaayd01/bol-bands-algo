# Bollinger Bands Algorithm Project
Implementation of a Bollinger Bands algorithm, with a simple web application built around it.

## What it does?
Spins up a web application (Client, Server + Flask Server) which evaluates the price of the USD / ETH pair every 24hrs against a Bollinger Bands analysis methodology.

## Purpose
More of just a personal learning project to try out a couple things:
* Python / Flask, also connecting a Node (Express) server to a Flask server
* Python -> Pandas, basic statistical manipulations
* Automated deployments using CircleCI + Docker
* GraphQL and Vue
