# TODO 13/04/2019

1. CRUD for Positions
    - I need to also check the logic for evaluating postiions

2. Deployement to Digital Ocean
    - I'm not the biggest fan of Heroku
    - It's really great to quickly deploy, however the costs are prohibitive for what you are getting. Also it would be beneficial for me to learn some DevOps skills through this project.

## 1. CRUD
1. CRUD Positions through front end interface
1. Should probably also build an authentication layer while I'm at it, to make the app feel more real and secure. Also good thing to practice.

---
## 2. DevOps Ideas
1. I'd like to use Digital Ocean (**DO**) as the cloud provider.
1. Would be nice to have automatic deployment
1. Dockerized
1. Look into what needs to be done to serve in production
1. Dockerized MongoDB instance
    - How do people seed mongodb?
